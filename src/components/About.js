        I'm on a top secret mission. I can't tell you what that is exactly, but
        I decided to take the scenic route. I grew up in the early 90s, meaning
        I saw & experienced the evolution of today's technology. It was only a
        matter of time before I graduated with a BA in Computer Science then
        climbed ladders, ran lines, and repaired computers with a small IT Team,
        and now I write things that will turn into 1's and 0's (machine
        language). When I'm not entering the matrix, you'll probably find me
        cooking something I've never made before, watching movies, anime,
        history & myths, or playing an old video game with considerations to
        stream it live. I also enjoy learning anything because it keeps the
        sparkle in my eyes & the fire alive.
